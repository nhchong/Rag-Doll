The additional feature that I chose to implement was multiple ragdolls. The two different designs I chose to implement was a dog and a tree. 

Dog:
* The Torso can me translated and scaled which will scale everything else
* THe Dog's upper legs can be rotated 90 degrees
* The Dog's lower legs can be rotated 45 degrees
* THe Dog's tail can be rotated 360 degrees

Tree: 
* The trunk of tree can be translated and scales which will scale everything else
* The branches can be rotated 90 degrees.
* The leaves can be translated
